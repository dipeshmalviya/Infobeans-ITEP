1) What is String in Java?

In Java, String is a class that represents a sequence of characters.

Strings are stored as objects in Java (not as primitive data types).

Example:

String name = "Hello";

2) Mutability and Immutability

Immutability â†’ Once an object is created, it cannot be changed.

In Java, String objects are immutable.

Example:

String s = "Hello";
s.concat(" World");
System.out.println(s);  // Output: Hello (not Hello World)


ðŸ‘‰ A new String "Hello World" is created in memory, but s still refers to "Hello".

Mutability â†’ An object whose value can be changed after creation.

In Java, StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable (can be modified).

Example:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World");
System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello World


âœ… In short:

String â†’ immutable (cannot be changed once created).

StringBuilder/StringBuffer â†’ mutable (can be modified).
